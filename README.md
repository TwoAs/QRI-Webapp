# QRI-Webapp

Inventory checking app using QR-codes. This project was designed to be used by small businesses trying to find an easier and more convenient way to keep track of inventory and orders across one or more store locations.

### Documentation

We'll be writing all of our documentation using markdown. Documentation for both [QRI-back](https://github.com/TwoAs/QRI-Back) and [QRI-front](https://github.com/TwoAs/QRI-Front) will be housed here in the main repo. Here is a link to a guide for markdown in [Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you have any other links, that would helpful @aaronbrown404

Here is a list of items that need to be documented:

- [x] Project Timeline

- [ ] QRI-Back
  - [x] database schema
  - [x] handlers
  - [ ] router
- [ ] QRI-Front
  - [ ] CSS framework
